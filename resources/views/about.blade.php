                I am trained in 3D Modelling using the program Maya by Autodesk and coding in the programming language of C# script.
                My passion is problem solving and delving into the depth of everything. I truly enjoy learning whether it be a new skill or simply attaining more knowledge. I would go as far as to refer to myself as a scholar; not to say that I am the best at everything, but I certainly have a hunger for knowledge. I constantly strive to ask the bigger questions and believe thereâ€™s always more to discover. I strive for excellence in my work but more specifically, delivering what people want. I want people to be satisfied with their product and beyond. I enjoy 3D modelling and photography; but am most in tuned to cinematography and video editing.
